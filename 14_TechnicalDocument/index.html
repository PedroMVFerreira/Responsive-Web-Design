                        The C language is a general-purpose and procedural-oriented programing language.
                        It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at the AT&T Bell Laboratorie.
                        History of C language revolves around development as a system implementation language write an operating system.
                        Its main features include low-level memory acess as wll as high-level memory access, and because of that its a middle-level programming language.
                        Many languanges have derived syntax directly or indirectly from C.

                            To learn about the history of C language, let's first start with its root and early developments. 
                            The root of all modern languages is ALGOL (Algorithmic Language). 
                            ALGOL was the first computer programming language to use a block structure, and it was introduced in 1960.
                            n 1967, Martin Richards developed a language called BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language). BCPL was derived from ALGOL. 
                            In 1970, Ken Thompson created a language using BCPL called B. 
                            Both BCPL and B programming languages were typeless.
                            After that, C was developed using BCPL and B by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell lab in 1972. 
                            So, in terms of history of C language, it was used in mainly academic environments, but at long last with the release of many C compilers for commercial use and the increasing popularity of UNIX, it began to gain extensive support among professionals.

                        <p>
                            In 1983, ANSI formed the X3J11 committee to standardise the C programming language. 
                            The Accredited Standards Committee X3 (ASC X3), Information Technology, was in charge of this endeavour, which led in ANSI X3.159-1989: Programming Language C being ratified on December 14, 1989 and published in the spring of 1990. 
                            With some new additions, this original standard unified existing practises. 
                            The standard stated in the ANSI X3.159-1989 document was known as ANSI C at the time in the history of C language, however it was quickly superseded when ISO/IEC 9899:1990 was established as an international standard, thanks to the efforts of ISO/IEC JTC 1. 
                            While this is where the name ISO C came from, the national and international standards are now known as C89 and C90, respectively.
                            There have been several updates and corrigenda produced in the years since the ISO/IEC 9899 international standard was established. 
                            The current C programming language is defined by ISO/IEC 9899:2018 – Information technology – Programming languages – C, the fourth edition of the standard. 
                            C11 is the informal term given to the C language established by the 2011 edition of the standard. 
                            While neither this, nor the titles ANSI C and ISO C are ever expressly referenced in the standard text, their occasional usage underscores the significance of the hard work carried out by the standards community over the previous thirty years in unifying this programming language.

                        <p>Execution of the C program involves 5 steps. These are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Creating the Program</li>
                            <li>Pre processing</li>
                            <li>Compiling the Program</li>
                            <li>Linking the Program with functions from the C library</li>
                            <li>Executing the Program</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>1. <span class="stand">Creating the Program: </span>Firstly, we need to create a C program. 
                            For that, we will open a text editor and write our C program into it. 
                            Then save the file with .c extension. 
                            For example: hello.c The program written into the file is known as the source code, and it serves the original form of the C program.
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <span class="stand">Preprocessing: </span>Preprocessing is the stage where source code is passed for the first time. 
                            This stage consists of the following steps:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Expansion of Macros and Comment Removal</li>
                                <li>Expansion of the included files</li>
                                <li>Conditional compilation The preprocessed output of hello.c is stored in the file hello.i.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <span class="stand">Compiling the Program: </span>Once our source code is preprocessed in the file hello.i. 
                            Now our file is ready for compilation, which after compilation produces an intermediate compiled output file hello.s, which is in assembly level instructions. 
                            During the compilation process, the compiler checks for all the compilation errors. 
                            If the C compiler gives no error, then the hello.s is taken as input and turned into hello.o by the assembler in the next phase. 
                            This file contains machine-level instructions. 
                            At this phase, only existing code is converted into machine language, and the function calls are not resolved. 
                            Since the object file is not executable, the process is transferred to the linker, which ultimately produces a .exe file.
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <span class="stand">Linking the Progam wiht functions from the C library: </span>This is the final phase, in which all of the function calls are linked to their definitions. 
                            Linker knows where all these functions are implemented.  
                            The linker performs additional work and adds more code to our programme that is required when it starts and stops. 
                            Setting up the environment, for example, requires a code, as does sending command-line inputs. 
                            The linker connects the object code of our programme file to the C library functions, resulting in an.exe file, hello.exe, which is an executable file, will be created here.
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <span class="stand">Executing the Program: </span> The execution of a program is a very simple task. 
                            After giving the command to execute a particular program. 
                            The loader will load the executable object code into the RAM and execute the instructions.
